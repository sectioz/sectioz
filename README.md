- 👋 Hi, I’m @sectioz
- 👀 I’m interested in cybersecuriy and other related fields. I graduated with a Bachelor's in Cybersecurity and looking to put some effort in programming once again. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning risk management frameworks and mitigation methodologies along with Linux distributions. Other hobbies I enjoy are video games and movies.

- I don't really dive into AAA games anymore, just the indie scene at this point as AAA games became bland over the years..

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on huge ambitious projects as I learn languages such as Python, Machine Learning concepts, and C/C++.
